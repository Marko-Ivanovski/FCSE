//Write a program that will print the sum of all numbers divisible by 3 and not divisible with 2 in the interval [A, B), where A and B are entered from the keyboard.
//
//Explanation of the example:
//A = 10, B = 20. The numbers that belong to the interval are 10, 11, 12, 13, .., 19. Among them, the number divisible by 3 and not divisible by 2 is 15, so their sum is 15.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b, sum=0;
    cin>>a>>b;
    for(int i=a;i<b;i++){
        if(i%3==0 && i%2!=0){
            sum+=i;
        }
    }
    cout<<sum;
    return 0;
}
