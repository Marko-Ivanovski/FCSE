//Igor wants to make a fruit salad. To do that, he goes to the market where the prices are as follows:
//
//The price of 100 grams of apples is 30 denars,
//
//the price of 100 grams of raspberries is 50 denars, and
//
//the price of 100 grams of bananas is 40 denars.
//
//If he buys 200 grams of one type of fruit (apples/raspberries/bananas), he gets a 30% discount, and if he buys 500 grams or more of one type of fruit, he gets a 50% discount.
//(Example: He will get a discount if he buys 500 grams of just raspberries, not a total of 500 grams from all fruits)
//
//Additionally: When paying, we check if Igor wants to use 140 denars from his daily student meal card.
//If YES, 140 denars are subtracted from the total amount; otherwise, the amount remains unchanged. How much money does Igor need to pay extra?
//
//Explanation of input parameters: We have how many grams he wants to buy of each fruit, respectively in the order apples, raspberries, bananas, and 1 or 0 depending on whether he wants to pay 140 denars with his student card or not
